GO

I'm choosing golang as the programming language for my 'fantasy' team of developers. It's a compiled language used a lot in devops, containers, and it's a wonderful versatile language, however,
it still lacks the ecossystem that other languages like Python or Javascript have at the moment.

Regarding the lint, after a quick google search, you can use the golangci-lint package, apparently golang already comes with native packages for testing and building as well, just some terminal
commands and you're good to go so I can't write much about it.

as for alternatives to jenkins and gitlab actions you can use microsoft's azure dev ops to set up CI, it's quite popular nowadays and offers a suite of CI/CD integration with your projects,
complete with pipelines and other features, despite being a cloud solution it offers a lot of flexibility and customization for any language.

I believe that a project with 6 people and depending on the security concerns it would be far better to have a cloud-hosted environment, especially with languages that are compiled such as go.
it adds resources as  it needs making scalability a non-issue, and the team is somewhat small which offers great tools for a small team
